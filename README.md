[] - remove arrows from number inputs
[] - add some check to mark that exercise is done or set is done and then that set or exercise is marked to different color and inputs are disabled
[] - timer and exercise name should be sticky on top and always visible even when i scroll
[] - in the future we can implement feature where after i mark set as complete we start tracking time between sets to measure how much break i had
[] - maybe add notes to each exercise/training
